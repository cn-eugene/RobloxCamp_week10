Hello, Sensei Katie Here!
I was not the teacher for this camp. Sensei Alex guided the first few days, but fell sick.
Thankfully, Interns Akshaya and Camden were troopers and took the camp under their wings.
Each kid who wanted to keep their content from the camp will have uploaded RELEASE titled with their name.

Have a GREAT school year- we hope to see you again :)
Best, Sensei Katie (Code Ninjas)
